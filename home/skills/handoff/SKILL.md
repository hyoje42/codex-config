name: handoff
description: "Use this skill when the user requests a handoff or summary of the current conversation context for continuing work in a fresh session. Trigger on requests like \"handoff\", \"save context\", \"summary for next session\", \"export conversation\", \"save work state\", or any request to capture the current state of work for later continuation. Use when the user wants to transfer context to a new Codex session, save progress before ending a session, or provide a summary for another agent to continue the task. Do NOT use for general summarization, code explanation, or documentation unrelated to handoff purposes."

# Handoff

## Purpose

Capture the current conversation context so a fresh Codex session can continue the work without missing any information.

## Handoff Workflow

0. **Check existing handoff files** (if continuing work):
   - Check if `.codex/handoffs/` directory exists and search for folders matching the task slug: `ls -d .codex/handoffs/*-[task-slug] 2>/dev/null`
   - If exists, list all handoff files: `ls -lt .codex/handoffs/*-[task-slug]/ | grep HANDOFF`
   - Read the most recent handoff file to understand previous progress
   - Reference previous handoff when creating new one to maintain continuity
1. **Analyze the conversation**: Review the full conversation history
2. **Identify key elements**: Tasks attempted, what worked, what didn't work, current state
3. **Create handoff file**: Save as `.codex/handoffs/YYMMDD-[task-slug]/HANDOFF-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Always save files in the **project root's** `.codex/handoffs/` folder (NOT `~/.codex/` global folder)
   - Extract task name from conversation, convert to slug (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
   - **Use Korea Standard Time (KST, UTC+9)**: Run `TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%y%m%d"` for folder date, `TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` for file timestamp
   - Folder name uses KST date prefix (`YYMMDD-[task-slug]`) for chronological sorting
   - Use current KST date and time (HANDOFF-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS format) for file name to prevent overwriting
   - **CRITICAL**: Always check if file exists before writing. If exists, add incrementing number: `HANDOFF-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-2.md`
4. **Provide summary**: Give the user a brief overview of what was captured

## Handoff Template

Create `.codex/handoffs/YYMMDD-[task-slug]/HANDOFF-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# [Task/Topic] - HANDOFF

## Reference Handoff (if continuing from previous handoff)

**Previous Handoff**: `.codex/handoffs/YYMMDD-[task-slug]/HANDOFF-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`

This handoff continues work from a previous session. The following sections integrate previous progress with new developments.

## Real Example

```markdown
# DroidRun Knowledge System Improvement - HANDOFF

## Task Overview

Analyze DroidRun's Knowledge storage and retrieval system, create improvement plan, and implement changes.

## Current Progress (2026-02-10)

### 1. Completed Tasks
- ✅ Complete knowledge system structure analysis
- ✅ Add quality tracking fields and methods to models.py
- ✅ Ensure JSON compatibility in to_dict(), from_dict()

### 2. In Progress
- 🔄 Create quality.py file - KnowledgeQualityManager class implementation needed

### 3. Planned Improvements Summary
- Phase 1: Quality management (mostly complete)
- Phase 2: Semantic search

## Identified Issues
1. Keyword matching only, cannot capture semantic similarity
2. No feedback loop
3. No version control

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1 (Quick improvements - 2 days)
1. Create quality.py with KnowledgeQualityManager class
2. Add version control to storage.py

### Phase 2 (Medium effort - 1 week)
1. Implement semantic search with embeddings
2. Add feedback loop mechanism

## Key File Modifications

### Priority 1 (Core logic)
- **✅ Completed**: models.py - Added quality tracking fields and JSON methods
- **⏳ In progress**: quality.py - KnowledgeQualityManager class implementation
- **❌ Not started**: storage.py - Version control for knowledge entries

### Priority 2 (New features)
- **❌ Not started**: semantic_search.py - Embedding-based search implementation

## Notes

### What Worked
- Quality tracking fields fully implemented
- JSON compatibility ensured

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
- **Issue**: User cancelled Edit operation
  - **Cause**: Description was too brief
  - **Resolution**: Changed to explanation-then-approval approach per response-format.md rules
  - **Lesson**: Always provide detailed explanation before Edit call

### Current State
- Quality tracking fields and methods in models.py completed
- Only quality.py creation remaining

## Next Steps (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Create KnowledgeQualityManager

**File**: droidrun/knowledge/quality.py

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from .models import Shortcut, Tip, KnowledgePool

class KnowledgeQualityManager:
    def __init__(self,
                 min_quality_score: float = 0.3,
                 max_failure_count: int = 5,
                 prune_unused_days: int = 90):
        self.min_quality_score = min_quality_score
        self.max_failure_count = max_failure_count
        self.prune_unused_days = prune_unused_days

    def prune_low_quality(self, pool: KnowledgePool) -> int:
        # Pruning logic
        pass
```

## Resuming Work
1. Read and understand this file
2. Create quality.py file
3. Add version control to storage.py

---

**Note**: For resuming work, load the most recent handoff file for the task:
```bash
ls -lt .codex/handoffs/*-knowledge-system-improvement/HANDOFF-*.md | head -5  # Show recent files
```
```

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Include exact file paths, code, and commands
- **Focus on continuity**: Next agent should be able to continue without reading full conversation
- **Include failures**: Knowing what didn't work is as important as what worked
- **Keep it concise**: 100-300 lines - enough detail to continue, not a full transcript
- **Actionable next steps**: Include code so next agent can start immediately

## Creating the File

```bash
# Step 1: Check for existing handoff files
# Use the project root's .codex/handoffs/ folder (NOT ~/.codex/ global folder)
EXISTING=$(ls -d .codex/handoffs/*-[task-slug] 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1)
if [ -n "$EXISTING" ]; then
    echo "Existing handoff folder found: $EXISTING"
    ls -lt "$EXISTING"/ | grep HANDOFF | head -5
    # Read the latest handoff to reference previous work
    LATEST=$(ls -t .codex/handoffs/*-[task-slug]/HANDOFF-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    if [ -n "$LATEST" ]; then
        echo "Reading latest handoff: $LATEST"
        # Reference this file when creating new handoff
    fi
fi

# Step 2: Generate KST date and timestamp
# Use KST timezone: YYMMDD for folder, YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS for file
KST_DATE=$(TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%y%m%d")
KST_TIME=$(TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")

# Step 3: Ensure directory exists with date prefix (replace [task-slug] with actual task name)
# IMPORTANT: Always use the project root's .codex/handoffs/ folder
mkdir -p .codex/handoffs/${KST_DATE}-[task-slug]

# Step 4: Create .codex/handoffs/${KST_DATE}-[task-slug]/HANDOFF-${KST_TIME}.md
# Example for "Knowledge System Improvement" task:
KST_DATE=$(TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%y%m%d")
KST_TIME=$(TZ='Asia/Seoul' date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")
mkdir -p .codex/handoffs/${KST_DATE}-knowledge-system-improvement
# Then create: .codex/handoffs/260211-knowledge-system-improvement/HANDOFF-${KST_TIME}.md
# Example: .codex/handoffs/260211-knowledge-system-improvement/HANDOFF-2026-02-11-143045.md
```

## Storage Location

- **ALWAYS** save handoff files in the **project root's** `.codex/handoffs/` folder
- **NEVER** save files in `~/.codex/` (global user folder) — only use the project-level `.codex/` directory
- `.codex/handoffs/` is NOT auto-loaded into Codex's context, so it won't consume extra tokens
- This ensures handoffs are project-specific and can be tracked in git when desired
