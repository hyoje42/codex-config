# Handoff Template

Create `.handoffs/YYMMDD-{task-slug}/codex-handoff-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md` with the following structure. Drop sections that genuinely do not apply rather than leaving them empty.
Translate section headings and prose into the user's explicitly requested language; if no language is specified, use the user's preferred language. Keep file paths, code identifiers, and commands unchanged.

```markdown
