# Decision Packages

Every stop shows the user one package in their language. A package reports what agents already verified and asks only for decisions agents cannot make. Keep it short; link the stage files instead of pasting them.

## Shared Shape

1. **First line:** what is being decided and the orchestrator's recommendation.
2. **Verified by agents:** what was checked, by which judge (name the model when known), and the result. Include known weaknesses such as "same-model reviewer" or "no integrity checks".
3. **Needs your decision:** only items agents could not settle, each with options and a recommended one.
4. **Files:** paths to the stage files for detail.
5. **Ask** using the mechanism in SKILL.md: at most 3 questions per batch, recommended option first. When a question tool is unavailable or disallows approval requests, ask in the final response and wait for the reply.

## Intent Stop ([1])

Ask only outcome-changing unknowns that the repo and context file could not answer. For each, state what was already checked and why it did not settle the question.

## Spec Package ([2])

- Goal restated in one sentence.
- Spec checklist (IDs and one line each), with the facts, hypotheses, decisions, and unknowns kept separate.
- Slots: 5-a gates, 5-b judges, done definition, K, and risk tier, each marked as from the context file or a default.
- Mode the run will use. If on mode was requested and refused, name the failed precondition.
- Resolved roster: runner and model per role, with any model that is assumed rather than known marked as such.
- Slice plan: slices, parallel groups, dependencies.
- Plan-review result: verdict per round, what it caught and fixed, findings applied without re-review after a failed last round, and any open disagreement.
- A context-file draft, if [0] created one.
- Options: approve, change (say what), stop.

## Final Package ([5-b], in mode)

- Verdict of the judges and the recommendation.
- 5-a results: commands and exit codes.
- 5-b results: deterministic judges, then `reviewer-5b` findings with severity.
- Every finding fixed automatically, with the spec item it cited and how it was fixed.
- Spec gaps, spec items the reviewer could not check, and residual risks. Each spec gap needs a decision: add it to the spec, or accept the work as is.
- Reviewer notes, copied as written.
- Integrity-check results: the change list, and any violation that was repaired.
- Proposed changes to `.loop/context.md`, as written in `6-context-proposal.md`.
- Options: accept, send back to the spec (say what is wrong), stop. Accepting does not approve a commit; propose the commit separately.
- A second question in the same decision package: apply the context proposal, apply it with changes, or leave the context file as it is.

## Escalation

- What stopped the loop: the limit hit, the out-of-scope action, the failed integrity check, the spec gap, or the unanswered unknown.
- What was tried, and the evidence (attempt count, gate output excerpt, finding).
- Options to continue, with a recommendation.

## Delivered Report (on mode)

The same content as the final package, written to `6-report.md` and summarized at the end of the run. The user reviews it after the fact and decides on `6-context-proposal.md` and the commit.
