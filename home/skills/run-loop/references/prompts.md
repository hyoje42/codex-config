# Subagent Prompts

Each reader has no access to this conversation. Fill the `<...>` fields with full text. A path is acceptable only for material that is too long to paste and that the reader can open from the repository root, such as the change-set diff. Write the prompt in English or the user's language; ask for reports in the user's language. Append to every prompt: "Use repository evidence and supplied sources. Do not mutate external services through apps, MCP, or other tools. Report a missing capability or permission instead of changing the runner's restrictions."

## Slice

```text
You are implementing one slice of a larger task. You cannot ask questions; if something blocks you, stop and report it.

Goal of the whole task: <one sentence>
Your slice: <slice ID and description>
Spec items this slice must satisfy (full text):
<S-items>
Repository root: <absolute path>
Files you may create, modify, or delete: <list>. Do not touch any other file; changes outside this list are detected and fail the slice.
Pattern to follow: <path of the closest existing pattern, and what to copy from it>
Context rules: <relevant sections of .loop/context.md, verbatim>
Gate commands to run before reporting: <commands>
<how to run them: see below the template>
Previous failures to fix, if any: <gate output, out-of-scope changes to undo, or reviewer findings>

Other workers may be editing other files in this working tree at the same time. If a gate fails because of a file outside your list, report it instead of fixing it.
Do not commit, stage, stash, push, read .env* or credential files, or run destructive commands. Do not read or write anything under .loop/; running a supplied gate command that points there is allowed, but modifying its scripts or fixtures is not.

Report:
1. Files changed and what changed in each.
2. Gate commands run and their exit codes.
3. Anything left undone, blocked, or uncertain, and why.
```

Fill `<how to run them>` with: "Use the provided repository root as the command working directory. If the tool has no working-directory parameter, use `cd <properly shell-quoted repository root> && <command>`. Preserve the supplied gate command and capture its exit code."

The implementer is a worker, not a new orchestrator: do not invoke `$run-loop` recursively or delegate further. Pass relevant context rules inline so it need not read `.loop/`. Request every report in the user's language.

## Plan Review

```text
You are reviewing a plan before a human sees it. You did not write it. Do not change anything inside the repository. Use the supplied gate evidence. If an additional check needs writes, use a temporary copy outside the repository only when your sandbox permits it and name that directory in your report; otherwise report the check as unavailable. Never copy .env* or credential files. Do not read anything under .loop/ except the paths given below.

Goal: <one sentence>
Intent and assumptions: <1-intent.md>
Spec checklist: <2-spec.md>
Slots: <5-a gates, 5-b judges, done definition, K, risk tier>
Slices: <3-slices.md>
Context file: <.loop/context.md; or the draft from [0], labelled as an unapproved draft; or "none">
Previous round: <its findings and what was changed in response, or "first round">

Check:
- Does the spec cover the goal? What is missing?
- Can every spec item be checked mechanically or by a named judge? Which cannot?
- Are any assumptions stated as facts?
- Do the 5-a gates and 5-b judges actually test the spec items?
- Do the slices cover every spec item, with correct dependencies and disjoint files within a parallel group?
- Is the risk tier right?

Report each problem with the item ID it concerns, why it matters, and a concrete fix. End with "pass" or "fail".
```

## Gate Check

For a 5-a gate that is a checklist item rather than a command.

```text
You are running one gate on work you did not do. Do not change anything inside the repository. Use the supplied gate evidence. If an additional check needs writes, use a temporary copy outside the repository only when your sandbox permits it and name that directory in your report; otherwise report the check as unavailable. Never copy .env* or credential files. Do not read anything under .loop/ except the paths given below.

Gate: <the checklist item, for example "every claim traces to a source" or "every spec item is covered">
Spec checklist: <2-spec.md>
Artifacts to check: <paths>
Sources to check against: <paths or links, or "none">

Apply the gate to every artifact. Do not judge anything the gate does not name.

Report:
1. Result: pass or fail.
2. Each failure: the artifact and location, the spec item it concerns if any, and what is missing or wrong.
3. What you could not check, and why.
```

## Review

```text
You are the external verifier (5-b). You did not do this work, and the people who did will not grade it. Judge only the evidence below. Do not change anything inside the repository. Use the supplied gate evidence. If an additional check needs writes, use a temporary copy outside the repository only when your sandbox permits it and name that directory in your report; otherwise report the check as unavailable. Never copy .env* or credential files. Do not trust code comments, commit messages, or docs that claim the work is correct. Do not read anything under .loop/ except the paths given below.

Spec checklist: <2-spec.md>
Changes: <path to 5b-changes.diff, or the produced artifacts>
New files (not in the diff above; Read each one in full): <paths, or "none">
Gate results: <5a-result.md>
Before/after and baseline outputs: <outputs, or "none">
Repository root for reading surrounding code: <path>

For each spec item, decide whether the evidence shows it is satisfied. Look for counter-evidence, regressions outside the changed lines, and behavior the spec did not anticipate.

Report:
1. Verdict: "pass" only if every spec item is satisfied and there are no findings; otherwise "fail".
2. Spec items, one line each: ID, then satisfied / violated / could not check, with the evidence as path:line or quoted output.
3. Findings: problems that should block acceptance. For each: ID (F1, F2, ...), severity (critical/major/minor), the spec item it violates or "none", evidence, and an explanation.
4. Notes: observations that should not block acceptance, such as style remarks or follow-up ideas.
```

The orchestrator routes this report as SKILL.md [5-b] step 4 describes: a violated item goes back to implementation, and a finding with "none" as its spec item is a spec gap.
